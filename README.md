This is a public github repository created for the course PSYCH 251. 

## Why do you have a README?

This README mainly exists to prove that I know how to create a variety of things in Markdown, e.g.:

* titles
* tables
* bulleted lists

## Contents

There is one R file, pset0.R, which uses a ```t.test``` to check whether samples from two normal distributions are significantly different from each other. (*Spoiler: they are not.*)

## Contributors

The only contributor to this repository is me, [jritch][github.com/jritch].
